## About The Project

Can I BIke? is a responsive application that allows a user to view weather data anywhere in the world to make a determination if one is able to ride a bike in the weather conditions. The goal of this project was to showcase some skills in data visualization. For this project, I used Formidable Labs Victory library for much of the chart rendering.

New feature ideas: 
- [ ] Add more charts for different data
- [ ] Add users
- [ ] Allow users to set parameter for their preferred biking conditions.

## Reflections
I really like the idea of useful apps that can be used quickly in the moment. Like someone who might use [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) on their phone, this app would give the user quick necessary information. That is what I want with this app. I want a user to be able to wake up, check their app and almost instantly know if they can bike that day. I find that I am usually sifting through all of the data in the weather app to make a determination. Currently this application is set to parameters that I am comfortable biking in but someone else may not. Next I will have a settings page for users to set their parameters manually.
